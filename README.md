Developing a method to segment and benchmark segmentation for neuron cells in spatial transcriptomic image data.

This project involves a 4 step process:

Creating images for analysis using pre-created scripts.
Developing a segmentation method for neurons (watershed).
Running a benchmarking analysis for segmentation optimization.
Applying optimized segmentation for gene indicator collection.
